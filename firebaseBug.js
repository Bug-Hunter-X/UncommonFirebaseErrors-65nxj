The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the rules in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore are too restrictive.  For example, if you try to read or write data that your security rules don't allow, you'll get a permission denied error.  Another subtle issue is asynchronous operations. If you're not handling asynchronous calls correctly (using `.then()` and `.catch()` or `async/await`), you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors, especially when dealing with data updates or authentication.
